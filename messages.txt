Hey, how are you guys?
I'm really good! I just came back from a camping trip in Tahoe.
Wow, how kind of you to ask me! Are you trying to start something? Well, that's too bad isn't it. I'm not going to answer your question, instead I will insight you in some vocabulary! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, antidisestablishmentarianism, and hippopotomonstosousquipidaliaphobia. YOU ARE WELCOME!
Mary Poppins was one of my favorite movies growing up! Bugs Life, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, The Little Mermaid, and Chicken Run! What about you guys?
