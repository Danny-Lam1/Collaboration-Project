Hey, how are you guys?
I'm really good! I just came back from a camping trip in Tahoe.
Wow, how kind of you to ask me! Are you trying to start something? Well, that's too bad isn't it. I'm not going to answer your question, instead I will insight you in some vocabulary! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, antidisestablishmentarianism, and hippopotomonstosousquipidaliaphobia. YOU ARE WELCOME!
Mary Poppins was one of my favorite movies growing up! Bugs Life, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, The Little Mermaid, and Chicken Run! What about you guys?
You have sinned.
Why would you say that? And I do not have a favorite movie 
I do not have a favorite movie because I do not watch movies. You know this. Why would you even ask that? WHAT KIND OF FRIEND ARE YOU?! Anyways, moving on. How are you guys! This question was already asked, so don't answer that! Instead, here are some song lyrics! Si, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirandote, tengo que bailar contigo hoy. Vi, que tu mirada ya estaba llamandome, muestrame el camino que ya voy. Once again, you are welcome.
Tu espanol es tan bueno que pienso que naciste hablando espanol. 
Fijate que despues de tomar la clase de AP Spanish he mejorado mi gramatica! Danny como sientes que ha mejorado tu espaniol en tu nuevo livel este ano? Danny tambien te quisiera pedir que pares de cantar es cancion! La me canse de escucharla 
Que chistosa!
